# Free RDP Access by TOOLBOXLAP

This project sets up a free Windows RDP every 6 hours using GitHub Actions and Playit. 
The current RDP password is available at:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ansarig57/rdp-vm2/main/rdp-password.txt

## How it works

- GitHub Actions runs every 6 hours.
- Random password is generated and committed.
- You can view the latest password on the hosted Netlify page or directly from GitHub.
